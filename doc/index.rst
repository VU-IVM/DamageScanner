DamageScanner: direct damage assessments for natural hazards
==============================================================

A python toolkit for direct damage assessments for natural hazards. Even though the method is initially developed for flood damage assessments, it can calculate damages for any hazard for which you just require a vulnerability curve (i.e. a one-dimensional relation). 

**Please note:** This package is still in development phase. In case of any problems, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please raise an *issue*. 

Background
##########

This package is (loosely) based on the original DamageScanner, which calculated potential flood damages based on inundation depth and land use using depth-damage curves in the Netherlands. The DamageScanner was originally developed for the 'Netherlands Later' project `(Klijn et al., 2007) <https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/WL_rapport_Overstromingsrisicos_Nederland.pdf>`_.  The original land-use classes were based on the Land-Use Scanner in order to evaluate the effect of future land-use change on flood damages.
